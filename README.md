To run the code on VSCode you are required to download the extention "CODE RUNNER" and allow this extention to run on the terminal.

steps to allow on terminal:
    
    1- press "CTRL +," open search bar
    2- type "Code Runner: Run In Terminal" in the search bar
    3- Check the box next to Code Runner: Run In Terminal. This will ensure that the code is run in the terminal rather than the output pane, which allows it to accept input.
    4- now the user can provide inputs through the terminal.

To run the code the shortcut is "CTRL + ALT + N"
